# Peaches and Eggplants
Peaches and Eggplants is a quick incremental game that I put together as a challenge to make a completed game in under three hours while I was on my most recent flight from Charlotte to Phoenix. I've recently found that working on small, non-day job projects while I fly is a soothing and low-pressure way to practice writing code, and P&E is the most recent iteration of that.

The basic gameplay of Peaches & Eggplants is simply to press whichever item is on the screen at the top when it shows up in the canvas. The game starts when the page loads and goes on as long as you want it to.
